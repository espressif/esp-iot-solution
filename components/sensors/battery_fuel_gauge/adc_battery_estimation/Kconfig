            The number of ADC measurements to take before filtering the battery voltage, the
            higher the value the more stable the battery voltage will be, but will take longer

            First-order low-pass filter coefficient for battery capacity calculation.
            The value is divided by 10 to get the actual coefficient (e.g., 2 means 0.2).
            Lower values provide more smoothing but slower response to changes.
            Higher values provide less smoothing but faster response to changes.
