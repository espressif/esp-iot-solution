            Enable software JPEG decoder for EAF files with JPEG-encoded blocks.
            Disabling this option saves ~19KB DRAM but JPEG blocks will fail to
            decode with a runtime warning.

            If your EAF files only use RLE/Huffman encoding (no JPEG blocks),
            you can disable this to reduce memory usage.
