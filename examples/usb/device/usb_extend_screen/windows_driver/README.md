## Windows IDD Driver

The Windows Indirect Display Driver (IDD) model provides a simple user-mode driver model to support monitors that are not connected to a traditional GPU display output. [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/indirect-display-driver-model-overview)

This driver is based on [chuanjinpang/win10_idd_xfz1986_usb_graphic_driver_display](https://github.com/chuanjinpang/win10_idd_xfz1986_usb_graphic_driver_display). If you need to modify it, download and recompile it yourself.

## Notes

* The device's VID and PID must match the description of `DeviceName` in the driver INF file. For composite devices, use `USB\VID_303A&PID_2986`; for display-only devices, use `USB\VID_303A&PID_2987`.

* The driver communicates with the device through the VENDOR interface, supporting multiple resolutions and image formats, controlled via the interface string descriptor. For details, refer to the [README](https://github.com/chuanjinpang/win10_idd_xfz1986_usb_graphic_driver_display/blob/main/README.md).

* The driver supports only Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. Please test on other systems independently.
