ESP-WROVER-KIT features the following integrated components:

* ESP32-WROVER-E module
* LCD screen
* microSD card slot
* RGB LED

Its another distinguishing feature is the embedded FTDI FT2232HL chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. ESP-WROVER-KIT makes development convenient, easy, and cost-effective.

Most of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the board’s pin headers for easy access.
