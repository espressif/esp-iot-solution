# KeyBoard Example

The ESP-KeyBoard project is a keyboard project using the ESP32-S3, supporting N-key rollover, dual-mode USB and Bluetooth output, over 40 types of local lighting effects, and WIN11 lighting effect synchronization. It also supports low-power Bluetooth, significantly extending the keyboard's wireless usage time.

## Main Software Features

* Supports N-key rollover key scanning
* Supports low-power key scanning
* Supports USB 1K report rate
* Supports BLE 125Hz report rate
* Supports BLE battery level reporting
* Supports local lighting control with over 40 types
* Supports `Windows 11` dynamic lighting control

#### QA

How to modify local lighting effects:

  * Use `idf.py menuconfig` and enable or disable relevant lighting effects under `(Top) → Component config → rgb matrix`.

How to modify key mappings:

  * Please modify the key mapping table in [keymap.h](./components/esp32_s3_kbd_kit/include/bsp/keymap.h) file.
