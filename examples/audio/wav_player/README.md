# WAV Player Example

This example will show how to configure and operate the LEDC peripheral to play WAV files that store in flash or sdcard.

## How to Use Example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-S2-Saola, ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, etc.)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming

The following is the hardware connection:

|SoC|GPIO|
|:---:|:---:|
|ESP32|speaker(R) ----- GPIO25<br />speaker(L) ------- GPIO26|
|ESP32S2|speaker(R) ----- GPIO1<br />speaker(L) ------- GPIO2|
|ESP32S3|speaker(R) ----- GPIO1<br />speaker(L) ------- GPIO2|
|ESP32C3|speaker(R) ----- GPIO1<br />speaker(L) ------- GPIO2|


You can connect two speakers to gpio of the SoC directly, as shown in the figure below. The volume of this connection will sound small.

```
             47R
GPIOX +----/\/\/\----+
                      |    
                      | /|
                     +-+ |   Speaker
                     | | |     or
                     +-+ |  earphone
                      | \|
                      |
                      +--------------+ GND

             47R
GPIOX +----/\/\/\----+
                      |    
                      | /|
                     +-+ |   Speaker
                     | | |     or
                     +-+ |  earphone
                      | \|
                      |
                      +--------------+ GND

```

### Configure the Project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

* Select where to play WAV files in menu "WAV Player Configuration", it will play the file in flash by default.
* Set the flash size to 4 MB under Serial Flasher Options.
* Select "Custom partition table CSV" and rename "Custom partition CSV file" to "partitions.csv".

(Note that you can use `sdkconfig.defaults`)

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

1. When choosing to play the file in flash, the application it will initialize the spiffs and then play audio file `sample.wav` with pwm.
The following is the output log:

```
I (335) wav player: [APP] Startup..
I (339) wav player: [APP] Free memory: 299824 bytes
I (344) wav player: [APP] IDF version: v4.2-rc-5-g511965b26

I (640) wav player: frame_rate=32000, ch=1, width=16
I (30426) wav player: File reading complete, total: 1920000 bytes
```

2. When choosing to play the file in sdcard, the application it will initialize the sdcard and then play all files with `.wav` suffix.
The following is the output log:

```
I (354) wav player: [APP] Startup..
I (358) wav player: [APP] Free memory: 299384 bytes
I (363) wav player: [APP] IDF version: v4.2-rc-5-g511965b26

```

## Troubleshooting

### Program upload failure

* Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
* The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_init_sd_scr: send_scr (1) returned 0x107` error

Check connections between the card and the ESP32. For example, if you have disconnected GPIO2 to work around the flashing issue, connect it back and reset the ESP32 (using a button on the development board, or by pressing Ctrl-T Ctrl-R in IDF Monitor).

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_check_scr: send_scr returned 0xffffffff` error

Connections between the card and the ESP32 are too long for the frequency used. Try using shorter connections, or try reducing the clock speed of SD interface.
